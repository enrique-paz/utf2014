  <h2>Vaughan Scholarship Helps Neal Applin Reach His Goals</h2>

         <p>Jean and Bill Vaughan meet with Richard Etter, left, and Neil Applin, right, two of the 2013-2014 recipients of The William and Jean Vaughan Scholarship.</p>    
   </div>

  </div>
<p>After receiving his associate’s degree in 1992, Neal Applin, 42, planned on finishing his bachelor’s degree “but never got around to it.” Going back to school would be daunting enough for anyone, let alone someone working 50-60 hours a week while raising six young children. </p>

<p>Three years ago, with four biological children at home, Mr. Applin and his wife, Jennifer, met two six-year-olds with special needs from an orphanage in Russia. “We ended up falling in love with them and were lucky enough to adopt them,” he said.</p>

<p>When he returned part-time to UT a year later, he found simultaneously going to school, holding a job, and raising a large family to be demanding and chaotic. “Time has been a precious resource,” he noted. “It has been difficult to find the time for classes and homework, but it has also been incredibly rewarding.”</p>

<p>Mr. Applin said their lives turned even more challenging in the fall of 2013 when his wife, a homemaker and freelance writer, became seriously ill and eventually underwent brain surgery. During her illness and recovery, she was unable to drive or work. </p>

<p>The financial burden of medical and educational costs proved to be even more of an obstacle than the time constraints. “I’m the primary breadwinner in our family, and my salary just barely provides for our family of eight,” he said. </p>

<p>Fortunately for the Applins, financial aid and support through privately funded scholarships, including the William and Jean Vaughan Scholarship at the UT Foundation, lightened that burden.</p>

<p>Bill Vaughan (Bus ‘57) and his wife,&nbsp Jean (Bus ’92), endowed the Vaughan Scholarship in 1997 as a way of giving back while helping UT students achieve their goals.</p>

<p>“There was a point in my life when it was obviously very clear to me I had to have an education, but my economic situation seemed to make this impossible,” said Mr. Vaughn, founder of The William Vaughan Company. “The Korean War and my enlistment in the Air Force showed me how to do it. There was nothing unusual about my actions, but doors were opened which I didn’t know existed.”</p>

<p>“It seemed to me Neal was in a position like mine. You have to recognize where you are and accept that is the starting point. Then you have to find what works for you to reach your goal.” </p>

<p>Thanks to perseverance and scholarship assistance, Mr. Applin graduated with a bachelor’s degree from UT’s College of Adult and Lifelong Learning (CALL) this past summer semester, sooner than he originally expected. “Scholarships allowed me to take more classes to finish sooner, not incur nearly the debt I would have had to take on through loans, and provided me peace of mind knowing that we wouldn’t have to struggle further to pay those all off,” he said. </p>

<p>Mr. Applin and Mr. Vaughan both credit CALL with providing the special services and support necessary for adult learners to succeed.</p>

<p>“I support CALL because I think it provides a second chance for many,” said Mr. Vaughan. “When I think how much different my life would have been without one, I am forever grateful and gratified if I can help others have a second chance.”</p>

<p>While Mr. Applin is excited about achieving his academic and professional goals, he looks forward to walking away with more than just the piece of paper necessary to advance his career.</p>

<p>“Not finishing my bachelor’s degree was something that I always regretted. Now, I won’t have to live with that regret,” he said. “I want to be the best role model I can be for my children. I want to show them that it is never too late to accomplish their goals.” </p>
